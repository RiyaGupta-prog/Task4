Task 4 - Binary Classification using Logistic Regression

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship by Elevate Labs (Ministry of MSME, Govt. of India).  
The goal is to build a **binary classifier using logistic regression**.

---

 🧠 Objective

Build a logistic regression model to classify breast cancer cases as **Malignant (1)** or **Benign (0)** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.

---

 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Dropped irrelevant columns
   - Encoded categorical target
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Standardized the features

2. **Model Training**
   - Trained a logistic regression model

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision, recall, F1-score
   - ROC-AUC score and curve

4. **Sigmoid Function Visualization**
   - Plotted sigmoid curve to explain threshold tuning
